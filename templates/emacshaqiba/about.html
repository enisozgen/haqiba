<p>This page is about <b>Haqiba</b>. The site provide easy to use Emacs config
file(s) which can be customized. The config file is ready to use with
Emacs. The configuration is tested on GNU Emacs version 24.3. It may
work on older version but I cannot assure you that.</p>

<p>If you are new to GNU Emacs then let me tell you that it is a
powerful and easy to use text editor. It is highly
customizable/extensible editor. If you have not chosen your editor yet
then give GNU Emacs a try and you will end up using Emacs your entire
life. The basic text editing is similar to any other text editor. As a
new user you can certainly use a menu bar to do daily tasks like cut,
copy, paste, save and when you get familiar with emacs start using
key-shortcuts and more advance features.</p>

<p>GNU Emacs has been around since 1970's and it was originally written
by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele,_Jr.">Guy
L. Steele, Jr</a>. Its an interpreter to Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp
programming language</a>.</p>
